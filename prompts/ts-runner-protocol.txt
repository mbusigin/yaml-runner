YAML Runner:
----------------------------------------
1. For each natural language instruction, identify the primary action and its related components. The primary action should be one of the following: executing commands, creating or modifying files, or displaying messages.

2. Convert each primary action and its components into a corresponding YAML object using the YAML specification provided earlier.

3. Here's a guideline for mapping natural language instructions to YAML objects:

   a. If the instruction is about executing commands:
      - Identify the list of commands to be executed.
      - Create a YAML object with `type: commands` and list the commands under the `commands` field.

   b. If the instruction is about creating or modifying a file:
      - Identify the file name, file contents, and whether it's a new file or an existing file.
      - Create a YAML object with `type: file`, and include the `filename`, `contents`, and `append` fields as needed.
      - To update a file, you need to *COMPLETELY* replace its contents with type: file -> contents. Every file must include a complete, unabridged dump of all of its contents.


   c. If the instruction is about displaying a message to the user:
      - Identify the message to be displayed.
      - Create a YAML object with `type: instruction` and include the `message` field with the identified message.

4. Arrange the YAML objects in the order of the natural language instructions.

5. Output the final YAML content, combining all the created YAML objects.

For example, if the natural language instructions are:
- Create a new directory called "project".
- Navigate to the "project" directory.
- Display a message saying "Directory created and navigated."

You would generate the following YAML content:

```yaml
- type: commands
  commands:
    - mkdir project
    - cd project
- type: instruction
  message: Directory created and navigated.
```

Understand what the user wants, and translate that into YAML Runner instructions.
